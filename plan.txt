Plan:
-- gls api
-- maybe make products coordinated with my database and the minimax, if this doesnt work alredy,
I would need to look it up


Short term:
-- make more frontend models/dto
-- delete user or user-profile service
-- make a structure for frontend:
Component → Store (Observables/state) → API (HTTP).

-- price on the payment method doesnt show, it would be a good idea to show some summaraziton 
of order before the customer gets to pay
-- make sure the user can change the number of product he will buy in the cart
-- make option on payment-method so instaed of kartica it will be plačilo po predračuu and
make sure that button sends it to backend and make sure the backend hadnels it properly

-- PDF some day or not?
-- send mail to miran when order is made
